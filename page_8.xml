      <pText><![CDATA[A good application of an interrupt is reading a rotary encoder or observing a user input.
      Generally, an Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) should be as short and fast as possible. If our sketch uses multiple ISRs, only one can run at a time. Other interrupts will
      be executed after the current one finishes in an order that depends on the priority they have. Typically, global variables are used to pass data between an ISR and the 
      main program. To make sure variables shared between an ISR and the main program is updated correctly, declare them as volatile. The only type of interrupt that the
      “Arduino language” supports is the attachInterrupt() function. The format of attachInterrupt() function is as follows.attachInterrupt(digitalPinToInterrupt(pin),ISR,mode); 
      digitalPinToInterrupt(pin): change the actual digital pin to the specific interrupt number.
      pin: the pin number
      ISR: the ISR to call when the interrupt occurs
      mode: defines when the interrupt should be triggered.
      The following three constants are predefined as valid values for the mode of the pin.
